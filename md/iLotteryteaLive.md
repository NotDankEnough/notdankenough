A bot that tracks messages from Twitch users as anonymous. Differences from the first version of the bot:
+ 👁 The bot collects messages with the user's public data *(username, display name, id)* and the channel where it was sent.
+ 💾 Saving all changes with user, like as changed user color, display name, etc.
+ ⚙ The bot is no longer for fun, more for utility.
+ [And soon will be more features <img src="https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emote/568146/1" alt="Copesen" title="Copesen">](https://github.com/notdankenough/iLotteryteaLive/projects/1)

> iLotterytea's bot is available on two platforms: [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/fembajtea) and [our website](https://hmmtodayiwill.ru/)
